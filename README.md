Preview of the application is available on Github Pages: https://moskopio.github.io/react-obj

Project was created mostly as a learning excersise with some self-imposed limitations to make it more fun ( :
It depends only on React and browser calls to WebGL 1.0 API. All of the obj file parsing, math operations, rendering, WebGL, GLSL code, UI, events handling etc is self-contained in this repository.
